# RPS-Multiplayer
### This is a multiplayer Rock, Paper, Scissors
* First, you type in your name and click the sign in button
* Second, if there are not already two players, you become a player. If there are, you become a viewer and will become a player when someone leaves the game.
* Third, once there are two players select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
* Once both players have given an input the winner will be decided and the players stats will be updated accordingly.
* The game repeats after that. Once you have signed in you have full access to the chat.
* The chat is visible to everyone on the page and clears when there is no one visiting the page.

This project is meant to demonstrate our proficiency with firebase to create a functioning multiplayer game.

### Ben Houston designed and created this multiplayer game for his coding bootcamp.
